1) For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

2) Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.   
If we were to market this program, we would target students and researchers who are seeking an efficient way to navigate large volumes of scholarly articles and quickly determine each article's relevance to a specific research topic. Our program allows users to input research topics into the system and generate a directed graphs displaying articles that are related to the given prompt. The graph also illustrates which articles reference the other, allowing users to efficiently, and visually assess the credibility of each article, as a frequently referenced source is likely a more relevant and trustworthy source to base research off of. Additionally, the program can also provide a summary for each of the articles, which is an invaluable feature for students trying to quickly gather data and key insights for their own research. We could also market our program towards those who enjoy learning about new topics. Our summarization feature allows users to quickly gain an understanding of a desired topic without having to read through pages of scholarly papers.

3) Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.   
Our program is designed to support all users who have an interest in academic research and aims to provide equitable access to all demographics. By incorporating features such as summarizing articles and visualizing displaying the relationships between sources, the program aims to remove barriers that users may encounter while trying to conduct academic research. These elements of our program align with the principles of the social model of disability, which emphasizes how the societal barriers and the environmental design of the human world create limitations for the individual rather than the impairment itself. The summarization and visualization feature may be useful to those with cognitive disabilities or attention deficit disorders as they make the process of researching a topic and validating of the credibility of a source more efficient for the user. The only demographic our program may less likely be used by are those with visual impairments since the results from any search queries that users make are visually displayed in the form of a graph on the screen. Summaries of the articles are also printed only in text, and accessing additional information about an article, such as its doi or web link, requires users to click on the nodes of the graph on the screen. If we were to continue the development of our program, we would prioritize ehancing the program's accessibility by implementing alternative navigation options that incorporate audio features, such as text-to-speech functionalities. These enhancements would help ensure that users of all demographics can equally engage with and beneift from the program’s features, and would enable our program to align closer with the first principle of design, equitable use.
