1) For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.


2) Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
If we were to market this program, we would target students and researchers who are seeking an efficient way to navigate large volumes of scholarly articles and quickly determine each article's relevance to a specific research topic. Our program allows users to input research topics into the system and generate a directed graphs displaying articles that are related to the given prompt. The graph also illustrates which articles reference the other, allowing users to efficiently, and visually assess the credibility of each article, as a frequently referenced source is likely a more relevant and trustworthy source to base research off of. Additionally, the program can also provide a summary for each of the articles, which is an invaluable feature for students trying to quickly gather data and key insights for their own research. We could also market our program towards those who enjoy learning about new topics. Our summarization feature allows users to quickly gain an understanding of a desired topic without having to read through pages of scholarly papers.

4) Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
