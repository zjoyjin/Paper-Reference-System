# Research-Paper-Reference-System
An applications build for students to help them cite and search their paper
## Description

Search and Data Handling: 
The program will web scrape the provided API to get data on relevant research papers. Using this data, it will analyze and summarize the paper, and determine itâ€™s relevance to the research topic and its relationship to other similar research papers. 

Graph Visualization:  
A directional graph will be used to display all the research articles associated with the topic searched. The nodes of the graph will represent a research paper. The edges of the graph, which will be directional, will represent citations (e.g. A -> B means A cites B). 

User Interaction:  
Using Java Swing, the program allows users to enter research topics and see relevant papers in the form of a graph. By clicking and dragging the graph, users can get a clearer view. Users are provided with the option to click a node for detailed information. They are also able to login in to save and check their search history and bookmark important papers for later access.
